![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/8-Channel-tracking-module/blob/main/8-Channel-tracking-module.jpg)
# Introduction
The 8-channel line tracking sensor module is specially designed for the line patrol function of robot car. It integrates 8PCS high-sensitivity infrared sensors, which can quickly and accurately detect the contrast information of black and white lines, and realize smooth route recognition functions. Supports IIC and serial communication, comes with standard IO interface and PH2.0 interface, can connect mainstream development boards (such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Micro:bit, etc.), and is easy to quickly access and expand. No need to manually adjust the potentiometer, users can let the module complete automatic calibration to adapt to line patrol maps of different materials. In addition, its onboard LED indicator can intuitively reflect the working status of each sensor. Whether it is a robot car in an educational project or an intelligent transportation equipment in practical applications, this module will be a good choice.

# Features
* 1) Equipped with key calibration function, no need to manually adjust the potentiometer, more convenient to use. 

* 2) Integrated with 8PCS high-sensitivity infrared sensors to quickly detect the contrast information of black and white lines. 

* 3) IIC and serial communication, compatible with a variety of control schemes, with standard IO interface and PH2.0 interface, easy to connect. 

* 4) On board MCU can read the data obtained by the infrared probe, and output digital and analog data. 

* 5) Can flexibly adapt to the line width range of 0.5CM to 6CM, with better adaptability.
